I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Yes, if there is something I am, is definetely nobody.
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.
From where?
Nowhere, again.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
or a dog who lives in a barrel of grog.
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
NOT my type of jog.
